                   <p >Hello ALL!! My name is Gayathiri.I am currently doing my 7th semester(final year) with an CGPA of 9.25.
                       I studied in Mangalam Matriculation Higher Secondary School near Chidambaram.
			     My 12th grade score was 574 out of 600 (95.6%)
			     and my 10th grade score was 492 out of 500 (98.4%).
			     My skillset includes Python, HTML,CSS.
                       I have a done a NPTEL course in Operating System Fundamentals and two course on Coursera
                      (Introduction to HTML5,Arduino platform)</p>

            <div id = "project" style = "display:none">
            <ul>
                  <li>I am currently working on two projects.</li>
			<li>First one is" A Novel Method for Handwritten Digit Recognition System".</li>
		      <li> In future automation will be incorporated in areas like bank and postal office where recognition of handwritten digits by machine is crucial.</li>
                  <li>The digits written by people will be automatically identified by our model.</li>
		      <li>My second project is designing an "Dual Band MIMO Antenna for 5G Smartphone Apllication".</li>
                  <li>This antenna mainly focuses on acheiving high data rate with low bandwidth by the application of MIMO technology.</li>
			<li>Small sized antenna is fixed on four edges of substrate which is modelled like a smartphone.</li>
                  <li>This can be developed in future for using n number of antenna.</li>
